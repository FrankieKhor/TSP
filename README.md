Second year algorithm module where we had to solve the travelling salsman problem 
Used different types of algorithm to solve TSP:
- Random Mutation Hill Climber
- Random Restart Hill Climber
- Stochastic Hill Climber
- Simulated Annealing 

Represented a tour as a permutation 
Fitness function is the length of the tour
Created a small change swapping 1 city thus creating another set of permutation 
Used minimum spanning tree in order to see how good our current solution is
